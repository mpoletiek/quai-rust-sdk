# Changelog

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 — prepared, unpublished

Initial modular Quai/Qi SDK release candidate, compared against the published
`quais@1.0.0-alpha.57` artifact. APIs may change during alpha development.

- Twelve crates cover typed addresses/amounts, crypto, consensus serialization,
  RPC/providers, ABI/contracts, signers, HD wallets, payment codes, keystores,
  browser adapters and the `quai-sdk` facade.
- Qi discovery defaults to 50 matching receive/change addresses, with fixed
  denominations, explicit deep ranges and mixed HD/imported/BIP47 ownership.
- Native and browser workflows support account/Qi preparation, exact fee checks,
  signing, submission, replacements, conversion/wrapping and settlement observations.
- Durable reservations, immutable signed candidates, authenticated full-wallet
  backups and coordinated IndexedDB restore support restart and recovery.
- Utility parity includes ten BIP39 wordlists, public derivation, bounded KDFs,
  curve helpers, threshold aggregation, fixed-point checked/wrapping arithmetic,
  transaction interchange, ABI reflection, typed data and resource fetching.
- Explicit Rust differences correct reference bugs and replace dynamic JavaScript
  lifecycle/coercion with typed values, bounded resources and caller-owned futures.

The [complete SDK guide](SDK_DOCUMENTATION.md) describes usage. The
[current comparison](SDK_PARITY_ANALYSIS.md) records the audited scope, deliberate
omissions, source corrections and useful Rust additions. The
[publishing guide](docs/PUBLISHING.md) describes the prepared registry metadata
and ordered upload procedure. No crate has been uploaded or name reserved.

This alpha is not production-qualified. Unmodified funded-node execution, mature
redemption spend, broader engines/extensions, sustained reliability/fuzz campaigns
and independent security review remain outside the established evidence. Read the
[security policy](SECURITY.md) before integration.
